<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>In this initial phase of the project, you will develop a prototype chatbot. This prototype will simulate interactions by providing scripted responses based on the time of day and the user&#39;s input regarding their interests in programming. The primary goal at this stage is to draft a user interaction script that showcases how the chatbot would behave in various scenarios. It is important to note that this version of the chatbot will not incorporate smart logic, external API calls, or real-time interaction with the ChatGPT API. The focus is on laying the groundwork for a simple yet interactive chatbot capable of introducing itself, adapting its greeting according to the time of day, and engaging the user with questions about their programming interests. Based on the user&#39;s responses, the chatbot will offer basic resources or advice tailored to the user&#39;s interests. This mockup serves as a foundational step, enabling us to visualize and refine the chatbot&#39;s interaction flow before integrating more complex functionalities in future iterations.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Draft a Script:</strong> Write a detailed script that outlines the chatbot&#39;s interactions, including how it adapts its greetings based on the time of day and how it inquires about the user&#39;s programming interests.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Simulate User Interaction:</strong> Create a mockup that simulates the chatbot&#39;s behavior in response to predefined user inputs. This should include a variety of greeting messages corresponding to different times of the day and tailored responses based on the user&#39;s stated programming interests.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Provide Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Use the simulated input from the user to generate scripted recommendations or advice related to programming resources. This aspect of the mockup should demonstrate how the chatbot could potentially offer value to the user based on their specific interests.</p>

<h3>Example 1: Morning Greeting and Interest in Web Development</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Hello&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Good morning! My name is Bot, and I&#39;m here to help you with programming. What area of programming are you interested in?&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;I&#39;m interested in web development.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Great choice! Web development is an exciting field. I recommend starting with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There&#39;s an excellent resource for beginners at <strong>hyperskill.org</strong>.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2: Afternoon Greeting and Interest in Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Hello&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Good afternoon! I&#39;m Bot, and my task is to assist you in learning programming. What areas are you interested in?&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Artificial intelligence.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Artificial intelligence opens up many possibilities. I suggest learning Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. You can start with courses on <strong>hyperskill.org</strong>.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 3: Evening Greeting and Interest in Mobile Development</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Good evening&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Good evening! I&#39;m Bot, your programming assistant. What area would you like to improve your skills in?&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Mobile development.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Mobile development is very popular right now. To begin, I recommend getting familiar with Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android. You can find an excellent introductory course on <strong>hyperskill.org</strong>.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 4: Night Greeting and Interest in Databases</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Hello&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Good night! I&#39;m here to help you with programming. What area of programming interests you the most?&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>User Input</strong>: &quot;Databases.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Bot Output</strong>: &quot;Databases are the cornerstone of many applications. I suggest starting with SQL, and then moving on to NoSQL databases. You can find a good educational course on <strong>hyperskill.org</strong>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
